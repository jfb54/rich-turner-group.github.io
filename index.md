I'm Rich Turner. I'm a Professor of Machine Learning in the Department of Engineering at the University of Cambridge and a Visiting Researcher at Microsoft Research Cambridge.

Over the last two years my work has been presented in oral presentations at top machine learning conferences including AAAI, AIStats, ICLR, ICML and NeurIPS and featured on BBC Radio 5 Live’s The Naked Scientist, BBC World Service’s Click and in Wired Magazine.

I have given keynote lectures and tutorials at the Machine Learning and Signal Processing Summer School, the International Conference on Machine Learning, Optimization & Data Science, and the Machine Learning Summer School. I also serve on the Steering Committee for the Cambridge Centre for Data Driven Discovery (C2D3) and have been awarded the Cambridge Students' Union Teaching Award for Lecturing.

My current research interests include:

* Generative models
* Bayesian inference
* Weather and climate predictions

Below you'll find information about my group.
