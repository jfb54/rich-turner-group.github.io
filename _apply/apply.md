title: Apply / Collaborate
---
If you are interested in applying to my group in Cambridge, please check the [guide on the CBL Machine Learning Group website](https://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/phd_programme_in_advanced_machine_learning/). You can also reach out to me or one of my students.

If you are interested in collaborating, please get in touch at ret26 at cam.ac.uk.

Please note that I very rarely take internship students and have more requests for these than I can reply to.
